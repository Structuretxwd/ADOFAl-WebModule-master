Force majeure:
     Article 117 of the Contract Law stipulates that if the contract cannot be performed due to force majeure, the liability shall be partially or fully exempted according to the impact of force majeure, unless otherwise provided by law. If force majeure occurs after the parties delay performance, they cannot be exempted from liability. For the purposes of this Law, the term "force majeure" refers to objective circumstances that cannot be foreseen, avoided or overcome.

     The natural nature of the goods themselves and the reasonable wear and tear of the goods: Article 311 of the Contract Law stipulates that the carrier shall be liable for damages for the damage or loss of the goods during transportation, but the carrier shall not be liable for damages if it proves that the damage or loss of the goods is caused by force majeure, the natural nature of the goods themselves or reasonable wear and tear, and the fault of the shipper or consignee.

     Fault of the creditor: Article 311 and Article 370 of the Contract Law stipulate that if the depositary delivered by the depositor is defective or special custody measures need to be taken according to the nature of the depositary, the depositor shall inform the depositor of the relevant circumstances. If the depositor fails to inform the depositor, resulting in the loss of the deposited goods, the custodian shall not be liable for damages; If the custodian suffers losses as a result, the depositor shall be liable for damages unless the custodian knew or should have known and failed to take remedial measures.
